- âœ… **No UI Changes**: Kept your existing design

### **2. NewCoursefirst.jsx**

| NewCoursefirst | `/learning/custom-modules/` | POST | Create module |
| ChapterAdding | `/learning/chapters/` | POST | Create chapter |
| CourseStudents | `/learning/assignments/` | POST | Assign to students |

## **Complete User Flow:**

1. **"Custom Learning"** â†’ View all modules
2. **"Create"** â†’ Step 1: Module details (name, description, image)
3. **"Next"** â†’ Step 2: Add chapters with questions/expected outputs
4. **"Next"** â†’ Step 3: Select and add students
5. **"Create & Assign"** â†’ Module assigned to students successfully
